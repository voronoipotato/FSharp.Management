Example
-------

This example demonstrates the use of the FileSystem type provider:

*)
// reference the type provider dll
#r "FSharp.Management.dll"
open FSharp.Management

// Let the type provider do its work
type Users = FileSystem<"C:\\Users\\">

// now you have typed access to your filesystem and you can browse it via Intellisense
Users.AllUsers.Path
// [fsi:val it : string = "C:\Users\All Users"]
